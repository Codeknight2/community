First, I would confirm that these polls are within the remit of the support scope facilitator based on the MIPs(particularly 101 and 106). I would then privately message Bob to confirm the poll contents. I would suggest splitting this into 3 polls.

#### Message to Bob

>To clarify, you are looking to poll the following changes proposed by Alice and Faraz: 
>
>Poll 1
>
>⦁	Increase of the Spork D3M Debt Ceiling from 50 million to 100 million DAI.
⦁	Increase the Target Available Debt from 5 million to 15 million
⦁	Increase the Debt Increase Cooldown from 28,800 to 86,400
>
>Poll 2
>
>⦁	Onboard ABC Token with parameters X, Y, and Z.
>
>Poll 3 
>
>⦁	Increase the Dai Deposit Rate on Spork from 2% to 2.5%

Assuming Bob agrees that this is correct, I would draft a PR for the included polls. I would have Bob review this PR to ensure correctness. After receiving his approval, I would prepare the polls to go live in the next weekly governance cycle and notify governance through the forums and Discord.
