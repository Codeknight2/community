#### My Interpretation of the MIPs and Plan

[MIP101 2.6.6](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP101#2-6-6-aligned-delegate-privacy) does not direct a facilitator to draft a poll in this instance. It states that "If thereâ€™s clear evidence or significant suspicion that the identity of an AD has been revealed, a FacilitatorDAO **must immediately derecognize the AD**." then goes on to add "FacilitatorDAOs **must err on the side of caution** and act in case there is **any kind of real possibility that the privacy of an AD is compromised**.". 

The wording could be improved, but in order to "err on the side of caution" an off-boarding by the Facilitator would unfortunately be the appropriate response here. This is consistent with [previous off-boardings](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/governance-scope-actions-pertaining-to-delegates-in-light-of-mip102c2-sp7-approval/20946) of ADs, which were not polled.

Additionally, the requirement for the AD's identity to remain hidden would make it impossible to guarantee a fair poll fair. Voters cannot be presented with all the evidence without risking the reveal of Clive's identity.

Unfortunately, the Atlas is quite clear here. Facilitators are required to "err on the side of caution" if there is a real possibility that an Aligned Delegate's identity has been compromised. I don't enjoy this part of the job, but the MIPs are quite clear on the subject.

No poll will be needed. Would you be willing to publicly confirm your request for a whistleblower bounty and provide the address to send the bounty to?

[Notice] Aligned Delegate Derecognition of Clive

Following concerns raised by a community member and further review of the situation, Codeknight, as Governance Scope Facilitator, is derecognizing AD Clive per the rules of the Atlas and MIP113. In the interest of transparency, I will summarize the evidence as best I can while protecting Clive's identity.

[Anonymized summary of evidence]

This evidence was brought forward to a community member with address [Diane's Address] Half of the AD Buffer will be used as a bounty to this community member, which will be included in the next executive.
